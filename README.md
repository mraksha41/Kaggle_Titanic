This notebook aims to explore the impact of socio- economic factors, such as class and fare, on survival rates and provide insights into historical inequalities. By utilizing machine learning models, this study will identify the influence of socio-economic factors on survival and predict survival outcomes. The findings can guide discussions on equitable emergency response strategies and improve understanding of historical biases.

We compare multiple machine learning models based on accuracy and ROC AUC metrics, followed by saving the best-performing model.
